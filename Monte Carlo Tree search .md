# what is Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) resource ?
 Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a search algorithm used in artificial intelligence and machine learning. It is a probabilistic algorithm that uses random sampling to find solutions to problems. MCTS is used to find solutions to problems such as finding the best path through a maze or finding the most likely outcome of a random event.
## why use Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) resource ?
 Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a resource used for finding solutions to problems. MCTS is a probabilistic algorithm that uses random sampling to find solutions to problems.
