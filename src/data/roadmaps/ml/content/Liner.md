# why use Linear Algebra resource
Linear Algebra is a powerful tool for solving problems in physics and engineering. It can be used to solve problems in physics such as finding the equation of a line, solving systems of linear equations, and finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix. Linear Algebra can also be used to solve problems in engineering such as finding the optimal path through a network, solving systems of linear equations, and finding the stresses in a structure.
